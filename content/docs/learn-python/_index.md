# The Python!

## WHAT is this?

Python is just the language for you.

## WHY is this important?

Python is simpler to use, available on Windows, macOS, and Unix operating systems, and will help you get the job done more quickly.

## WHY should I learn this?

Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being aÂ _very-high-level language_, it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries.

## WHEN will I need this?

You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of these tasks, but shell scripts are best at moving around files and changing text data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. You could write a C/C++/Java program, but it can take a lot of development time to get even a first-draft program.

## HOW does this work?

Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.
